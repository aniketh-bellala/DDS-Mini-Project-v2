##### To get the output for SA0 or SA1 faults on a specific position -

1. Set the input of x and y. Here x and y can be either 0 or 1.
2. To enable fault in any position, I.e., faults on a, b, c, d, e, f, g, or on position h - input fault type.
3.  For SA0 - the fault type should be 0; for SA1 - it should be 1.
4. Click on the Check button to get the result on the truth table.
5. Final output marked with red denotes faulty output.
6. For further simulation - repeat steps from 1 to 4.
